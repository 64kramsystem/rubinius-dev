This directory contains a very simple [mr]spec-style runner and a bunch of files
that contain 'test_case' methods returning a Hash of one node of the pt_testcase
tests. It is done this way for the following reasons:

* Speed. It was taking rbx+ruby_parser 6+ minutes to compile a file containing
  the whole pt_testcase Hash versus 6 sec - 1 minute to run this way.
* Simplicity. It is very easy to locate and edit one of the cases (yay, files
  exist for a reason). It is also easy to compose specs to run.
* Application. The runner presently assumes running under rbx, but this is a
  single point of code and can easily be generalized, even allowing the
  possibility of using a subprocess to generate the parse while using MRI to
  execute the runner.


Q. So, why wasn't mspec used?

A. It could have been used. However, this is pretty simple, eh?


The example hashes contain keys for RubyParser and SydneyParser. The
SydneyParser keys only exist where the output of SydneyParser after being passed
through the rewriter differs from the expected output of RubyParser.


Invoke the runner as follows:

  bin/rbx spec/parser/run.rb [options] (FILE|DIRECTORY|GLOB)+

The runner is also chmod +x and will execute with /usr/bin/env ruby by default.
Pass the -h option to see more options. It should give the following output:

  $ bin/rbx spec/parser/run.rb -h
  usage: run [options] (FILE|DIRECTORY|GLOB)+

  -p      Compare to raw ParseTree
  -r      Compare to RubyParser (default for -R)
  -s      Compare to SydneyParser (default for -S)
  -R      Get sexp from RubyParser
  -S      Get sexp from SydneyParser (default)
  -X CMD  Get sexp from invoking CMD (see -x)
  -x STR  Substitute into STR at %s
  -h      Show this message


To invoke with an external parser, follow this example:

  ruby -Ilib -rsexp spec/parser/run.rb -r -X 'parse_tree_show' spec/parser


There is also a convenience script for extracting the individual parser tests
from pt_testcase. Invoke as:

  spec/parser/extract_cases.rb [DIRECTORY]

It runs with MRI and puts the files in spec/parser by default.


Finally, thanks to Ryan Davis for ParseTree and pt_testcase and for doing
everything with tests in a way that drives me absolutely crazy, so I do it a
better way.
