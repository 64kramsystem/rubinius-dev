= StringIO
Pseudo (({IO})) class from/to (({String})).

This library is based on MoonWolf version written in Ruby.  Thanks a lot.

= Differences to (({IO}))

* not implemented: (({fcntl})), (({reopen})).
* (({fileno})) returns nil.
* (({pos=})) returns new position, not 0.
* (({ungetc})) does nothing at start of the string.
