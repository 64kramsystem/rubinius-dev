VM: a C++ VM for running ruby code
(Could probably use a better name than VM)

TASKS in test/:

make test:
  Runs all tests defined by test_*.hpp

make coverage:
  Generates a code coverage report, coverage/index.html, by running
  the tests.

NOTES:

*) classes defined in objects.hpp and builtin_*.hpp are C++ classes mapped
directly to ruby objects. 

*) Because of the previous point, NO virtual functions are allowed in these
classes. C++ inserts a pointer into every object which has virtual functions
and we must have complete control over the body of an object.

*) Similarly, only use single inheritance. This keeps the order of data
members consistent.
