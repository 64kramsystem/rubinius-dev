1. Getting the source

The source code is available from a Subversion repository. Ensure you have the
svn command available and check out the source:

  svn co http://code.fallingsnow.net/svn/rubinius/trunk rubinius

2. Requirements

Currently Rubinius can be built on UNIX-like systems, such as Linux and Mac OS X.
To build and run Rubinius (but not do development), ensure you have the following
dependencies installed:

	* Ruby gems 
	* rake gem
	* rspec gem (rspec.rubyforge.org)
	* rubyinline gem
	* ruby2ruby gem
	* glib2
	* pkg-config (or pkgconfig on OS X pkgconfig.darwinports.org)
	* ruby 1.8.x
	* gcc 4.x (version 3.x will not work)
	* zip and unzip commands
	* sydparse gem. You *must* get this from the Rubinius source directory 
	  /externals/syd-parser

3. Compiling Rubinius

You must ensure that you are using the sydparse gem provided with the Rubinius source.
Type gem list sydparse to see what sydparse gems are installed. Type rake build:syd
to build the included sydparse gem. The gem will be in externals/syd-parser/pkg/. 
Use the gem command to install it.

If you are not doing any development with Rubinius, you can compile just the C code
portions. Use the command: rake build

If you are doing development, there are several convenience compile commands. To get
a list of these, use the command rake -T build.
