 Running the C++ Branch
------------------------

1.  Get LLVM 2.3 or later from http://llvm.org
    - Simple build: `./configure [--prefix=...] && make; sudo make install`

2.  Optional but recommended, also get the LLVM GCC frontend, http://llvm.org
    - You can just get the binaries rather than source.

3.  Set up an altogether new clone of the repository for yourself:
    - For current committers:
        `cd $WHEREVER; git clone git@git.rubini.us:code my_cpp`
    - For others: `cd $WHEREVER; git clone git://git.rubini.us/code my_cpp`

3b. `cd my_cpp`

4.  Switch to the C++ branch:
      `git branch --track cpp origin/cpp; git checkout cpp`
    - The --track allows you to push and pull directly to/from the branch.

5.  All of the C++ work is in a subdirectory: `cd vm`

6.  Build the codebase: `rake build`

7.  Build and run the tests: `rake test`

8.  You can use `git pull` to get updates
    - Rubinius Rake tasks work too although for those you will need to
      cd back out of the vm directory.

9.  ...And `git push` to send back any of your commits to the C++ branch.
    - Same here with the Rbx Rake tasks.
