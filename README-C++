 Running the C++ Branch
------------------------

+  Set up an altogether new clone of the repository for yourself:
    - For current committers:
        `cd $WHEREVER; git clone git@git.rubini.us:code my_cpp`
    - For others: `cd $WHEREVER; git clone git://git.rubini.us/code my_cpp`

+ `cd my_cpp`

+  Switch to the C++ branch:
      `git branch --track cpp origin/cpp; git checkout cpp`
    - The --track allows you to push and pull directly to/from the branch.

+  All of the C++ work is in a subdirectory: `cd vm`

+  Build the codebase: `rake build`

+  Build and run the tests: `rake test`

+  You can use `git pull` to get updates
    - The 'rake git:pull' task currently doesn't work for the C++ branch.

+  ...And `git push` to send back any of your commits to the C++ branch.
    - Same here with the Rbx Rake tasks.
