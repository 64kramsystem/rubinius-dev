      <h1 id="multiple-language-and-platform-support">Multiple Language and Platform Support</h1>

<p>The Ruby programming language encompasses two different language syntax
versions, commonly referenced as &ldquo;1.8&rdquo; and &ldquo;1.9&rdquo;. Additionally, Rubinius must
support building on a variety of possibly quite different systems. Two
examples of very different systems would be Linux and Windows. The term
<em>multiverse</em> will be used to refer to language syntax or platform portability
issues and solutions.</p>

<h2 id="language-versions">Language Versions</h2>

<p>Rubinius uses the Melbourne parser to convert Ruby source code to an abstract
syntax tree (AST). Melbourne is an extraction of the MRI parser. Now that Ruby
has 1.8 and 1.9 language syntax versions, Melbourne actually contains two
different parsers: one that understands version 1.8 and one that understands
version 1.9.</p>

<p>While there are syntax differences between 1.8 and 1.9, the differences do not
end there. In addition, there are significant changes to some of the core
library classes (e.g. 1.9 adds the Encoding class) and changes to the standard
libraries (e.g. 1.9 adds the Prime library and removes the ftools library,
among many others).</p>

<p>The general approach used in Rubinius to support these different language
version is to provide a single executable that includes features of both 1.8
and 1.9. The executable has a default mode that can be selected when it was
built. Currently, the default mode is 1.8 support. See <code>configure --help</code> for
options to change the default mode. The executable can be passed an option
flag to start in a mode other than the default mode. Presently, using the
<code>-X19</code> option will enable 1.9 support. If the executable was built with 1.9
support as the default, using <code>-X19=no</code> will disable 1.9 support and provide
1.8 support instead.</p>

<h2 id="runtime-kernel">Runtime Kernel</h2>

<p>The Rubinius runtime kernel is composed of the base classes needed to support
executing Ruby code. The kernel is also referred to as the core library in
MRI. The Rubinius kernel is layered to enable a precise load order so that
Ruby features that depend on other features are loaded after the features that
they depend on. See <a href="/dev/bootstrapping/">Bootstrapping</a>.</p>

<p>The kernel uses text files that list the source code to load. These files have
the Ruby language version appended to the file name (e.g. to specify the load
order for <code>kernel/bootstrap</code> in 1.8 mode, the file is
<code>kernel/bootstrap/load_order18.txt</code>). In this way, multiple versions of the
language are supported by a single set of kernel files with different
load_order files specifying which files make up that version&rsquo;s runtime kernel.</p>

<p>Ruby features that are common to both 1.8 and 1.9 are located in the main
kernel files (e.g. <code>kernel/bootstrap/fixnum.rb</code> or <code>kernel/common/array.rb</code>).
Features that are specific to one version are located in files with the
version appended (e.g. <code>kernel/common/array18.rb</code> and <code>kernel/common/array19.rb</code>).</p>

<h2 id="standard-library">Standard Library</h2>

<p>The standard library is found in the <code>lib</code> directory. Libraries at the top
level are those that are provided in both 1.8 and 1.9. Libraries that are
provided by 1.8 but not 1.9 are located in the <code>lib/18</code> subdirectory.
Likewise, libraries that are only provided in 1.9 are located in <code>lib/19</code>.</p>

<h2 id="windows-portability">Windows Portability</h2>

<p>Rubinius builds on Unix and Linux operating systems. These systems tend to be
quite consistent and require few special cases. There are some build system
issues and a few preprocessor conditionals used.</p>

<p>Recently, we have been adding support for Windows using the
<a href="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW</a> environment.  This requires some additional
conditionals on header file includes, but the primary issue for Windows
support is that features commonly found on Unix/Linux systems may be missing.
There are three ways to handle missing features:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Raise an exception indicating the feature is not supported.</li>
  <li>Replace the feature with a compatible and available one.</li>
  <li>Implement the feature specifically for Windows.</li>
</ol>

<p>The main areas of incompatibility are threading, signals, process management,
environment related features, and networking/sockets.</p>
