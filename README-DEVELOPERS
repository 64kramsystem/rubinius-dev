1. Directories

* runtime/ contains run-time compiled files for Rubinius.  You'll use these
  files when running shotgun/rubinius
* runtime/stable/* is only used by commands run from the Rakefile.  You
  probably don't need to touch anything in here, but when you do, you can
  rebuild it with rake build:stable.

2. Primitives

To add a primitive:

* Give the primitive a sane name
* Implement the primitive in shotgun/lib/primitives.rb
* Give the primitive a number in compiler/primitives/primitive_names.rb
* `rake runtime/stable/compiler.rba`
* `rake`

If your primitive takes variable arguments, you need to provide a wrapper
method that calls the primitive.  For example Dir::glob calls
Dir::prim_glob.

3. gdb

You can run shotgun/rubinius with gdb.

* Run `shotgun/rubinius --gdb`
* Hit ^C to interrupt
* Type 'rbt' at the gdb prompt to get a ruby backtrace
