1. Files and Directories

* .load_order.txt explains the dependencies between files so the VM can load
  them in the correct order.
* kernel/ contains the ruby language additions to the basic VM.  These files
  are compiled into runtime/
* kernel/bootstrap/ contains the files needed to start up Ruby.
* kernel/core/ contains the rest of the Ruby language.
* runtime/ contains run-time compiled files for Rubinius.  You'll use these
  files when running shotgun/rubinius
* runtime/stable/* is only used by commands run from the Rakefile.  You
  probably don't need to touch anything in here, but when you do, you can
  rebuild it with rake build:stable.
* shotgun/ contains the Rubinius VM.
* shotgun/external_libs/ contains libraries required by Rubinius for
  convenience.
* spec/ and test/ contain tests for verifying that Rubinius implements Ruby.

2. Kernel Classes

If you create a new file in one of the kernel subdirectories, it will be necessary
to regenerate the .load_order.txt file in the equivalent runtime subdirectory in
order to get your class loaded when Rubinius starts up. Use the rake task
build:load_order to regenerate the .load_order.txt files.

3. Primitives

To add a primitive:

* Give the primitive a sane name
* Implement the primitive in shotgun/lib/primitives.rb
* Give the primitive a number in shotgun/lib/primitive_names.rb
* `rake runtime/stable/compiler.rba`
* `rake`

If your primitive takes variable arguments, you need to provide a wrapper
method that calls the primitive.  For example Dir::glob calls
Dir::prim_glob.

4. gdb

You can run shotgun/rubinius with gdb.

* Run `shotgun/rubinius --gdb`
* Hit ^C to interrupt
* Type 'rbt' at the gdb prompt to get a ruby backtrace

5. Specifications

RSpec is the machinery behind executing these specs. The intention is to have
specs for Ruby as a language and set of standard libraries, and to TDD/BDD the
development of Rubinius. Some spec subdirectories below are implementation
agnostic and some are specific to Rubinius.

For more information on the Ruby specs developed for Rubinius, see:
