1. Directories

* runtime/ contains run-time compiled files for Rubinius.  You'll use these
  files when running shotgun/rubinius
* runtime/stable/* is only used by commands run from the Rakefile.  You
  probably don't need to touch anything in here, but when you do, you can
  rebuild it with rake build:stable.

2. Primitives

To add a primitive:

* Give the primitive a sane name
* Implement the primitive in shotgun/lib/primitives.rb
* Give the primitive a number in compiler/primitives/primitive_names.rb
* rake runtime/stable/compiler.rba
* rake
