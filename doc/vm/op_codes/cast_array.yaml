mnemonic: cast_array
operation: >-
  Convert a tuple to an array, or wrap an object within an array
format: cast_array
opcode: 48
stack_before:
  - value
  - ...
stack_after:
  - array
  - ...
description: >-
  Removes the object on the top of the stack, and:
  
  If the input is a tuple, a new array object is created based on the tuple
  data.
  
  If the input is an array, the stack is unmodified.
  
  If the input is any other type, that type is wrapped within a new array of
  length one.
  
  The resulting array is then pushed back onto the stack.
