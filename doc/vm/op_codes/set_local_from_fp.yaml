mnemonic: set_local_from_fp
operation: >-
  Sets a method argument local from the caller's stack
format: set_local_from_fp locl arg
opcode: 95
stack_before:
  - ...
stack_after:
  - ...
description: >-
  Copies the value of method argument _arg_ into the stack local variable _locl_.
  Method arguments are accessed from the caller's stack via negative offsets from
  the frame pointer, where 0 is the first argument, 1 is the second, etc.
notes:
  If a method argument is modified in the body of the method, but is not 
  captured, it is allocated on the stack (rather than in the locals tuple); this
  op code copies its value into the allocated stack local so that it can be 
  modified within the method.
  
  If the method argument is captured, it must be allocated in the locals tuple.
