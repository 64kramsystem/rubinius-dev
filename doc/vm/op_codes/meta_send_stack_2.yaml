mnemonic: meta_send_stack_2
operation: >-
  Optimised send for performing a method taking two parameters (deprecated)
format: meta_send_stack_2 mthd
opcode: 75
stack_before:
  - recv
  - arg1
  - arg2
  - ...
stack_after:
  - retval
  - ...
description: >-
  Pops the receiver _recv_ off the top of the stack, and sends it the method
  identified by _mthd_. The two parameters _arg1_ and _arg2_ to be used by the
  method are left on the top of the stack to be converted to locals as the
  method is activated.

  When the method returns, the return value will be on top of the stack.
notes: >-
  This is an optimised send for methods taking two parameters and no block.

  This opcode has been deprecated, since it makes no noticeable difference to
  performance.
