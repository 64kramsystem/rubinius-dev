description: >-
  Performs a comparison of two objects, resulting in either _true_ or _false_
  being pushed onto the stack as a result. The comparison is done without any
  method calls.
  
  For two Fixnums, two Symbols, or two literals (_true_, _false_, _nil_), return
  _true_ if the values are identical.
  
  For two object references (including Bignum), return _true_ if value1 and
  value2 point to the same instance.
