mnemonic: sret
operation: >-
  Simple return from a method (only)
format: sret
opcode: 106
stack_before:
  - retval
  - ...
stack_after:
  - ...
description: >-
  Pops the top value from the stack, and uses it as the return value from a
  method.
notes:
  _sret_ is an optimised version of the more general "ret":ret. It works only
  with method returns, but as a result, can skip the extra work to figure out
  how to long return from a block.
see:
  - ret
source: |-
    t1 = stack_pop();
    cpu_simple_return(state, c, t1);
