mnemonic: send_stack
operation: >-
  Sends a message with arguments on the stack
format: send_stack mthd argc

description: >-
  Pops the receiver and the block to be passed off the stack, and sends the
  message _mthd_ with _argc_ arguments. The arguments to the method remain on
  the stack, ready to be converted to locals when the method is activated.

  When the method returns, the return value will be on top of the stack.
see:
  - send_stack_with_block
notes: >-
  This opcode does not pass a block to the receiver; see
  "send_stack_with_block":send_stack_with_block.html for the equivalent op code
  used when a block is to be passed.
