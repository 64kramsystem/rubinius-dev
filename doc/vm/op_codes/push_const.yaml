  pushes it onto the stack. If the constant cannot be found in the current
  context, nothing is pushed onto the stack, and a @NameError@ exception is raised.
example: |-
  engine = RUBY_ENGINE      # RUBY_ENGINE is a constant defined by Rubinius
source: |-
    next_literal;
    t1 = cpu_const_get_in_context(state, c, _lit);
    if(t1 != Qundef) stack_push(t1);
    c->cache_index = -1;
