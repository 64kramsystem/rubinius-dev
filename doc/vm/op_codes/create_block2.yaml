mnemonic: create_block2
operation: >-
  Creates a compiler2 style block
format: create_block2
stack_before:
  - cm
  - ...
stack_after:
  - blockenv
  - ...
description: >-
  Pops a compiled method _cm_ off of the stack, and converts it into a block
  environment _blockenv_, which is then pushed back onto the stack.
notes: >-
  This opcode replaces "create_block":create_block.html, which is used under
  compiler1, but deprecated under compiler2. Unlike create_block which
  uses the same instruction sequence as the enclosing method context,
  create_block2 takes its own instruction sequence in the form of a
  compiled method.
