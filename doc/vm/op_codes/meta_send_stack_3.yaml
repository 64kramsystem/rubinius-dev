mnemonic: meta_send_stack_3
operation: >-
  Optimised send for performing a method taking three parameters
format: meta_send_stack_3 mthd
opcode: 76
stack_before:
  - recv
  - arg1
  - arg2
  - arg3
  - ...
stack_after:
  - arg1
  - arg2
  - arg3
  - ...
description: >-
  Pops the receiver _recv_ off the top of the stack, and sends it the method 
  identified by _mthd_. The three parameters _arg1_ through _arg3_ to be used by
  the method are left on the top of the stack.
notes: >-
  This is an optimised send for methods taking three parameters and no block.
