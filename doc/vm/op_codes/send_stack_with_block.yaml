operation: >-
  Sends a message with arguments and a block on the stack
format: send_stack_with_block mthd argc
opcode: 42
stack_before:

  - blck

description: >-
  Pops the receiver _recv_ and a block off the stack, and sends the message 
  _mthd_ with _argc_ arguments. The arguments to the method remain on the stack,
  ready to be consumed when the method executes.
notes:
  This opcode passes a block to the receiver; see "send_stack":send_stack.html
  for the equivalent op code used when no block is to be passed.
