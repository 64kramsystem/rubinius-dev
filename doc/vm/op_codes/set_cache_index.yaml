mnemonic: set_cache_index
operation: >-
  Sets the cache index for a method from a call site
format: set_cache_index idx
opcode: 67
stack_before:
  - ...
stack_after:
  - ...
description: >-
  Sets the cache index to be used in the polymorphic inline cache (PIC) for
  the cache entry for a class, module, or method that is the subject of one of
  the following op codes:
  
      _open_class_, _find_const_, _add_method_, _attach_method_, _send_method_,
  
  _open_class_under_, _open_module_, or _open_module_under_.
notes: >-
  When the assembler encounters one of the above opcodes, it assigns the next
  index for a cache entry in the PIC for the opcode, and inserts a
  *set_cache_index* operation into the byte code just before the op code in
  question. The call site then retains a cache of the receiving object / method
  when the initial constant lookup or method dispatch occurs, so subsequent
  execution of the same byte code can perform a fast check to confirm the
  validity of the cache, and then return the constant or dispatch the method
  immediately if the cache is valid. This greatly speeds constant lookup and
  method dispatch, since the search step can be skipped.
