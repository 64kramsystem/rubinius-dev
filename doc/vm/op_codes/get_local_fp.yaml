mnemonic: get_local_fp
operation: >-
  Get the value of a local and push it onto the stack (deprecated)
format: get_local_fp idx
opcode: 100
stack_before:
  - ...
stack_after:
  - value
  - ...
description: >-
  Retrieves the current value of a local allocated on the stack, and pushes it
   onto the top of the stack.
  
  This opcode is now deprecated, and is not currently used under compiler2.
see:
  - allocate_stack
  - set_local_fp
notes: >-
  Local variables that are used within a method and not captured were
  previously allocated on the stack. This operation retrieves such a local, and
  places it on the stack. However, stack locals are no longer used under
  compiler2, and so this opcode is now deprecated.
