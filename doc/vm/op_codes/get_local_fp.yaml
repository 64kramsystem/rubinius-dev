mnemonic: get_local_fp
operation: >-
  Get the value of a local and push it onto the stack (deprecated)
format: get_local_fp idx
opcode: 100
stack_before:

stack_after:
  - value

description: >-
  Retrieves the current value of a local allocated on the stack, and pushes it 
  onto the top of the stack.

  This opcode is now deprecated, and is not currently used under compiler2.
notes:
  Local variables that are used within a method and not captured were previously
  allocated on the stack. This operation retrieves such a local, and places it
  on the stack. However, stack locals are no longer used under compiler2, and so
  this opcode is now deprecated.
