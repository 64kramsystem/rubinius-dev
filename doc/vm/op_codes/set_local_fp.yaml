mnemonic: set_local_fp
operation: >-
  Updates the value of a stack allocated local variable
format: set_local_fp idx
opcode: 99
stack_before:
  - value

description: >-
  Uses the _value_ on the top of the stack to update the value of the local variable
  allocated on the stack, identified by _idx_. The value is left on the stack, to
  represent the return value from the expression.
notes:
  Local variables that are used within a method and not captured are allocated
  on the stack. This operation updates such a local from the current top of the
  stack.
