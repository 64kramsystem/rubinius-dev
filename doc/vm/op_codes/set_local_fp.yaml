mnemonic: set_local_fp
operation: >-
  Updates the value of a stack allocated local variable (deprecated)
format: set_local_fp idx
opcode: 99
stack_before:
  - value
  - ...
stack_after:
  - value
  - ...
description: >-
  Uses the _value_ on the top of the stack to update the value of the local variable
  allocated on the stack, identified by _idx_. The value is left on the stack, to
  represent the return value from the expression.

  This opcode is now deprecated, and is not currently used under compiler2.
notes:
  Local variables that are used within a method/block and not captured were
  previously allocated on the stack. This operation updates such a local from
  the current top of the stack.
