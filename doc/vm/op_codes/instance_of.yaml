mnemonic: instance_of
operation: >-
  Evaluate if _object_ is an instance of _class_
format: instance_of
opcode: 91
stack_before:
  - object
  - class

stack_after:
  - result

description: >-
  If the object is an instance of _class_ return the special value _true_,
  otherwise return _false_. This check is different than _kind_of_ in that it
  does not evaluate superclass relationships. Instance-specific subtyping via
  metaclasses are ignored in computing the parent class.
