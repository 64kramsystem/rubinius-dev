mnemonic: from_fp
operation: >-
  Push an object from the caller's stack onto the current context's stack (deprecated)
format: from_fp idx
opcode: 94
stack_before:
  - ...
stack_after:
  - value

description: >-
  Copies a method argument that was on the stack before the method call and pushes it
  onto the stack in the current context. The argument _idx_ counts backwards from
  the frame pointer, with 0 referencing the first argument to the mehod, 1 the 
  second argument, etc.

  This opcode is now deprecated, and is not currently used under compiler2.
notes:
  The opcode *from_fp* exists as an optimisation in cases where arguments to a
  method are not modified. Rather than copying the argument off the stack and
  into the locals tuple, it can be copied directly from a frame pointer offset
  as needed.

  Under compiler2, all local variables are now allocated in the locals tuple,
  which simplifies local variable management and ensures the correct results
  when continuations are used. As such, this opcode is now deprecated.
