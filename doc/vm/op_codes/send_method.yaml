mnemonic: send_method
operation: >-
  Sends a message with no args to a receiver
format: send_method methodname
opcode: 40
stack_before:
  - recv
  - ...
stack_after:
  - retval
  - ...
description: >-
  Pops an object off the top of the stack (_recv_), and sends it the no arg
  message _methodname_.

  When the method returns, the return value will be on top of the stack.
see:
  - send_with_arg_register
notes: >-
  This form of send is for methods that take no arguments.
  
  Make primitives safer by having the opcode be aware of the number of args
  sent.  This way we can remove the dependency of primitives being embedded
  in methods.
