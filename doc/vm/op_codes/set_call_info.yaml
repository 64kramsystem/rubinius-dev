mnemonic: set_call_info
operation: >-
  Sets call flags and method cache index prior to a send operation
format: set_call_info flgs idx
opcode: 92
stack_before:
  - ...
stack_after:
  - ...
description: >-
  The call flags on the current execution context are set to the opcode
  argument _flgs_, and the method cache index is set to the argument idx.
notes: >-
  Currently, the only call flag is 1, which instructs the machine to include
  private methods when looking for a method that responds to a message.

  This opcode is a combination of "set_call_flags":set_call_flags.html and
  "set_cache_index":set_cache_index.html. It is used in place of the other two
  opcodes if method caching is enabled in the compiler.
