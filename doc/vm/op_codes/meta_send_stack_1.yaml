mnemonic: meta_send_stack_1
operation: >-
  Optimised send for performing a method taking one parameter (deprecated)
format: meta_send_stack_1 mthd
opcode: 74
stack_before:
  - recv
  - arg
  - ...
stack_after:
  - retval
  - ...
description: >-
  Pops the receiver _recv_ off the top of the stack, and sends it the method
  identified by _mthd_. The single parameter _arg_ to be passed to the method is
  left on the top of the stack, and is converted to a local when the method
  is activated.

  When the method returns, the return value will be on top of the stack.
notes: >-
  This is an optimised send for methods taking a single parameter and no
  block.

  This opcode has been deprecated, since it makes no noticeable difference to
  performance.
