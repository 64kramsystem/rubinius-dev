mnemonic: soft_return
operation: >-
  Soft return from a block
format: soft_return
opcode: 45
stack_before:
  - retval
  - ...
stack_after:
  - ...
description: >-
  Pops the return value from the stack, and returns to the calling method or
  block. The return value is pushed onto the stack of the caller during the
  return.
see:
  - sret
  - ret
  - caller_return
notes: >-
  Unlike "ret":ret.html, this return opcode does not consider non-local
  returns. It simply returns to the calling block or method context. Thus, it is
  used when, for example, breaking from a loop, or upon the normal completion of
  a block.
