mnemonic: send_off_stack
operation: >-
  Calls the method specified on the top of the stack on an object
format: send_off_stack
opcode: 88
stack_before:
  - mthd
  - blck
  - recv
  - args
  - ...
stack_after:
  - args
  - ...
description: >-
  Pops the name of the method _mthd_ to call off the stack, and if necessary,
  converts it to a symbol. Then pops any block _blck_ and the receiver _recv_
  off the stack. Any arguments required by the method are contained in the
  array _args_, which remains on the stack for when the method begins executing.
notes:
  The number of arguments to be passed to the method in _args_ must have been
  set previously via a call to "set_args":set_args.html.
