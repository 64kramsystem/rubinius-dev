mnemonic: set_literal
operation: >-
  Sets a literal to the specified value
format: set_literal lit
opcode: 107
stack_before:
  - regexlit

stack_after:
  - regex

description: >-
  Used to set the value of a literal that is a regular expression. The Regexp
  object to which the literal is to be set is copied from the top of the stack,
  but is not consumed.
notes: >-
  Unlike other literals such as strings and numbers, creating a Regexp literal
  (i.e. via the /regex/ syntax) is a two step process to create the literal slot
  for the Regexp, create a literal for the string between the '/' delimiters and
  create a new Regexp object passing it the string. Only then can the literal
  value be set, using the set_literal opcode.
