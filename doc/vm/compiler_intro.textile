Introduction to the Rubinius compiler
=====================================

This document presents the sequence of transformations that it takes
to compile a very simple Ruby source file into Rubinius bytecode (or,  
to be specific, intcode) for the purposes of understanding the basic
operation of the compiler component of the VM. Even source files with 
more complex syntax will follow the same general processing pattern.

The compiler is conceptually very straightforward and elegant.
Hopefully you will share my admiration for the architecture by
the time we are done.

I use a very liberal pseudocode syntax for most of the explanation
just to keep things simple. For any clarifications, you can check the
source. Generally any data structures shown represent what is being
passed to the next step rather than the state in the explanation just
above it: for example in the first stage, the sexp shown is always 
essentially the "argument" to the next method or section.
