Stage 3: Encoding and CompiledMethod
====================================

First of all, Rubinius does not actually use BYTEcode in the sense of
one-byte-wide opcodes so it is used here in its banal meaning of virtual
machine machine code. Rubinius' machine code is in fact INTcode. @encoder.rb@
will be the main venue here (although, again, "the VM docs":http://rubini.us/doc/vm
are an excellent resource for anything to do with Rubinius assembly and
bytecode.) The file is relatively short but 


The MethodDescription must be converted into a CompiledMethod 
next, and the
