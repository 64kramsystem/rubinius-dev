This directory contains documentation for the Rubinius VM.

Parts of this documentation are generated directly from the VM source code; this 
directory contains ruby code and templates used to generate both skeleton YAML
files for each opcode, and formatted HTML displaying the contents of the YAML
inputs.

The op_codes subdirectory contains the individual opcode files.

A Rakefile is provided to allow the generation of opcode YAML files, which 
contain the documentation for each opcode defined in the Rubinius VM. Note that
the doc:vm:yaml task can safely be run to update the YAML files without losing
descriptive content. Only the alias, opcode, and source fields are overwritten. 

After updating one or more YAML files, you can re-generate the HTML by running
the doc:vm:html Rake task.
