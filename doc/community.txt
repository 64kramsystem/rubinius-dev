## Communication

The Rubinius channel is #rubinius on the Freenode network,
irc://irc.freenode.net:6667.

[Chat Logs]http://donttreadonme.co.uk/rubinius-irc/ are also available.

IRC clients are available for all imaginable operating systems so you should
find one easily (many regular IM clients have one and Mozilla offers its
ChatZilla as a plugin for Firefox) so drop in for a quick nip or stay a while.

## Who's Who

primary identification. Here is a list in rough alphabetical order, add yours!
