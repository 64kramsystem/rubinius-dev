 Communication
---------------

The primary way that Rubinius developers communicate with each other
is IRC. Yes, we know it is the 21st century now--but give it a try. It
is even at this late date the best means of communication for a large
distributed project. IRC clients are available for any imaginable OS.
If it can access the Internet, it has an IRC client. More on IRC, a
list of clients and a nick list can be found [here](http://rubinius.lighthouseapp.com/projects/5089/irc-info-and-who-s-who).
[IRC logs](http://donttreadonme.co.uk/rubinius-irc) are also available.

If you cannot (or prefer not to) use IRC, feel free to ask questions
or submit patches via the mailing list as well. The mailing list *is*
relatively quiet currently because of the heavy emphasis on IRC but
rest assured, you will find yourself in a discussion on the ML as
well if you send the first e-mail.

If you are just starting with Rubinius feel free to ask for help! We
try to make sure that there is documentation available and someone
will always be able to answer questions--all we ask in return is
that you bring an inquisitive mind and are willing to do proactively
poke around the code or research otherwise also.
