private send

  A method call that has no explicit lexical receiver. The receiver of the
call is +self+. For example:

  class A
  private
    def you_are_mine
    end
  end

  class B < A
    def sunshine
      you_are_mine
    end
  end

  class C
    def dear
      today = B.new
      today.you_are_mine
    end
  end

The call to +you_are_mine+ in the method +sunshine+ is a private send. The
call to +today.you_are_mine+ will not succeed because private methods cannot
have an explicit receiver. In this case, the object +today+ is the explicit
receiver.
