# Running Gems on Rubinius

TODO: Imported from Lighthouse wiki. Likely outdated

## Main problem areas of Gem support

Many Gems either depend on currently not supported Ruby Standard Library
functionality or on not implemented Subtend (the MRI compatibility layer)
functionality.

Another problem to Gem support is left-to-right evaluation that is not yet
supported in Rubinius, but should be soon.

## Popular Gems

Here is a list of popular RubyGems that could be used to test Rubinius' compliance:

* RedCloth
* RSpec
* Facets
* Mocha
* Net::SSH
* Net::SFTP
* HighLine
* Hpricot
* Ramaze
* Daemons
* Ruby/Mysql (not a gem on it's own, but could be used to run ActiveRecord's tests)
* Ruby/Postgres (pure is a must, native would be great to have)
* Mongrel
* Thin
* Rack
* JSON (pure, native would be great)
* Rubigen
* Newgem
* Newjs
* merb-core
* naturalsort
* object_proxy
* rwb
* behaviors
* Memoized

## Ruby/Mysql

Tested on April 27 (under shotgun, needs to be tested under the new C++ VM).
Seems to be stable and usable, no problems with running SQL-Queries (Create,
Insert, Update, Select, etc.). Fetching rows from resultsets works, too.
