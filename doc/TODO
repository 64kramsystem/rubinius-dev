This is a list of tasks that need to be completed. I've tried to
group them by when they need to be done.

Before Alpha:
 - Ruby tasks:
   - Convert compiler infrastructe to SimpleSexpProcessor so..
   - Compiler can run natively within rubinius VM.
   - Get miniunit running in the VM, so...
   - BFTS tests can be integrated into main testing
  
 - C tasks:
   - Add baker GC resizing (fixed at 6M now)
      - On OOM, spill to next space and activate GC back in
        instruction loop.
      - After GC, detect how much free space is available.
        If there is A LOT, rescale next back a bit (using a
        reverse scaling factor so it gets smaller slowly)

Future:
  - Ruby tasks:
    - Get translation work so that prototype B ruby
      code can translated into C
  - C tasks:
    - Make use of train GC
