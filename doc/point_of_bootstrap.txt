The point of the bootstrap step is to build up just enough functionality to:

1. use alias
2. run FFI (for platform code)
3. provide basic error reporting (primary related to method_missing)

It also serves to attach all primitives. Primitives are *only* allowed to be
attached in bootstrap.

All functionality provided by bootstrap may be redefined in core to provide
a 'proper' implementation.

Rules of bootstrap:

1. Limited to no metaprogramming. The bootstrap should be a container of code
   only. If it runs code, then order starts to matter and things fall apart.
