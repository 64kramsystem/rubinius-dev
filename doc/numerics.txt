# Rubinius Numeric Tower

The way that the numeric tower is implemented in Rubinius, each basic class
(e.g. Fixnum, Bignum) implements specific versions of methods like #== as
primitives. If the primitive code fails (typically because it is unable to
coerce to a basic type -- see docs on primitives in general), the method on
the basic type delegates 'up' with a call to super.
