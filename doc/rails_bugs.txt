Code:

   column.limit = options[:limit] || native[type.to_sym][:limit] if options[:limit] or native[type.to_sym]

In mysql's case, type is :primary_key, and native[:primary_key] returns a 
String. Thus String#[] is called with :limit, which is not intended. This
happens to work in MRI because of Symbol#to_int, but the number is pretty
much random. String#[] happens to return nil if the number is too big
(which is pretty much always the case here).
