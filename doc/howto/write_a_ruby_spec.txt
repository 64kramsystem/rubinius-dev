= Howto - Write a Ruby Spec

Make sure you have read:

*   [Getting Started](/getting_started.html)
*   [The Rubinius Specs](/rubinius_specs.html)

Then, follow these steps to write a spec for a Ruby method:

1.  Edit a file under `spec/ruby/1.8/...`
1.  Run `bin/mspec -tr spec/ruby/1.8/some/spec_file.rb`
1.  Repeat until the spec passes on MatzRuby
1.  Run `rake git:status` OR `cd spec/ruby; git status`
1.  Change directory to `spec/ruby`
1.  Run `git status`, `git add`, `git commit`, etc.
1.  Run `git format-patch`
1.  Upload the patch in a ticket on the
    [rubyspec.org](http://rubyspec.org/projects/show/rubyspec) website

You're done. When your patch is accepted, you will get a commit bit to the
RubySpecs repository. However, while you're on a roll, why not add a patch for
Rubinius as well. See [Howto - Fix a failing
spec](/howto/fix_a_failing_spec.html)
