= Howto - Write a Rubinius Spec

Make sure you have read:

*   [Getting Started](/getting_started.html)
*   [The Rubinius Specs](/rubinius_specs.html)

Then, follow these steps to write a spec for Rubinius:

1.  Run <code>rake git:update</code> to ensure your code is current
1.  Run `rake` to ensure your build is current
1.  Edit a file under `spec/core`, `spec/compiler`, `spec/debugger,` etc
1.  Run `bin/mspec spec/some/spec_file.rb` to confirm that it fails
1.  Run `git status`, `git add`, `git commit`, etc.
1.  Run `git format-patch`
1.  Upload the patch in a ticket on the [Rubinius
    lighthouse](http://rubinius.lighthouseapp.com/projects/5089-rubinius/tickets)
    account

When your patch is accepted by the Rubinius project, you'll get a commit bit
for the Rubinius repository. You'll also get a bit for the RubySpec repository
(as long as you have a Github account and let us know your Github username).
