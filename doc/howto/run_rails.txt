# Howto - Run Rails

NOTE: Rails runs on the old VM (shotgun). We are still getting it running on
the new C++ VM.

## Installing the Rails gems

Rubinius has gem installed as a sub-command, so:

    rbx gem install rails

## Testing your Rails app

After that, you can use any gem-installed executable as a rubinius
sub-command. For example, to run your rails app's tests:

    rbx rake test

or to start up your rails app:

    rbx script/server
