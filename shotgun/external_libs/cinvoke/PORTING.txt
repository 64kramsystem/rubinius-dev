There are 4 steps (in general) to port C/Invoke to a new architecute:

1) copy lib/arch/empty_empty_empty.c and .h to files named
<compiler>_<cpu>_<os>.c and .h.  Add an entry to the main cinvoke-arch.h
file to include your new file.
2) Implement the new arch files.  Use the comments inside the empty files for
guidance, the other arch files for examples, and the cinvoke-dev mailing list
for help.
3) Get the source building.  If your chosen platform has 'make', then you can
make copies of the existing Makefiles and try to modify them.
4) Get the test suite in the test/ directory running and spitting out the
correct values.
