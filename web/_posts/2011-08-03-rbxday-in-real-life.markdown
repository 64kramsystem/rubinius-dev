The first ever [#rbxday](https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23rbxday) is fast
approaching on Friday, August 5th. Depending on your time zone, that is either
tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. To help you get prepared, here are a few
updates.

Originally, the idea for [#rbxday](https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23rbxday)
was a day that people all around the world could have fun experimenting with
Ruby and Rubinius. Try your application or pet Ruby project on Rubinius, or
pull out that idea you've been wanting to explore, code it up, and run it on
Rubinius. We are not asking anyone to contribute to Rubinius, but we would be
most flattered if you wanted to dig into the Rubinius code to see what's going
on under the hood. To sum up, the motto of the day is "Ruby, Rubinius, Fun Fun Fun Fun".

Of course, a great way to multiply fun is to share it with others. Several
people have taken the initiative of organizing meetups on
[#rbxday](https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23rbxday):

* **Mountain View, CA**: [@bcurren](https://twitter.com/#!/bcurren) co-founder
  of [Outright.com](http://outright.com), sign up at [rbxday.eventbrite.com](http://rbxday.eventbrite.com/)
* **Amsterdam**: [@dbussink](http://twitter.com/dbussink) long time
  Rubinius contributor, event at [80beans](http://80beans.com/en/blog/2011/07/29/rbxday-at-the-80beans-office)
* **Portland, OR**: [@kyledrake](http://twitter.com/kyledrake) avid
  Rubyist, event at [PIE](http://piepdx.com), see [Calagator.org](http://calagator.org/events/1250461183) for details
* **Barcelona**: [@txustice](http://twitter.com/txustice) inventor of [cool Rubinius technology](http://blog.txustice.me/2011/06/rexpl-interactive-bytecode-console-for-rubinius/), event at [Codegram](http://blog.codegram.com/2011/8/celebrate-rbxday-with-us-at-codegram)

A huge thanks to everyone who has organized one of these events. They did so
on their own initiative and show the true power of a community. If you're near
one of the events, please do attend. If not, *there's still time to organize
one near you.*

If you are joining [#rbxday](http://twitter.com/#!/search/%23rbxday) from the
comfort of your own home, tweet about it, include pictures, and join us in
the \#rubinius IRC channel on freenode.net. We would love to hear from you.

A final thought about all the ways you can help Rubinius. You don't have to
contribute code directly to help. Each of these activities is just as
valuable, and if you think of any I didn't include, please let me know:

* Wearing your Rubinius shirt
* Talking to co-workers about Rubinius
* Asking your company to sponsor some of your time contributing to Rubinius
* Writing libraries in Ruby
* Writing blog posts or books about Ruby technology, like fully-concurrent
  threads in JRuby and Rubinius 2.0
* Talking to people about what you find painful in Ruby and how we may be able
  to improve those pain points

Above all, please do have fun. That's no gimmick. The world needs more fun.

Put a tag on it [#rbxday](http://twitter.com/#!/search/%23rbxday).
