<p>Make sure you have read:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="getting-started/">Getting Started</a></li>
  <li><a href="specs/">Specs</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Then, follow these steps to fix a failing spec:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Run <code>rake</code> to ensure that all CI specs are passing.</li>
  <li>Run <code>bin/mspec spec/some/spec_file.rb</code> to confirm the spec fails.</li>
  <li>Edit a file somewhere in Rubinius (probably under the kernel directory).</li>
  <li>Run <code>rake build</code> to build your change.</li>
  <li>Run <code>bin/mspec spec/some/spec_file.rb</code> to see if your change makes the
spec pass.</li>
  <li>Repeat until your spec passes.</li>
  <li>Run <code>rake</code> to ensure there are no regressions.</li>
  <li>Change directory to Rubinius root if not already there.</li>
  <li>Run <code>git status, git add, git commit</code>, etc. Any changes made to the spec
files under the spec/ruby directory must be in a different commit from
changes made to other Rubinius source code files.</li>
  <li>Run <code>git format-patch origin</code>, which will extract commits that the current
branch accumulated since the last pull from origin, or `git format-patch
-N&rsquo;, where N is the number (1, 2, etc.) of commits for which you want to
generate patches.</li>
  <li>Create a gist with your patch and link to it in a ticket on the issue
tracker at http://github.com/evanphx/rubinius/issues. You can add multiple
patches to one ticket.</li>
</ol>

<p>When your patch is accepted by the Rubinius project, you&rsquo;ll get a commit bit
for the Rubinius repository. Let Evan know what your Github username is.</p>
