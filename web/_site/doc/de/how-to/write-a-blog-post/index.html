<p>The Rubinius blog uses Jekyll and is integrated with the website and
documentation. We encourage and appreciate guest blog posts about your
experiences using or developing Rubinius.</p>

<p>To get started, ensure you have the <code>kramdown</code> and <code>jekyll</code> gems installed.</p>

<pre><code>rbx gem install jekyll kramdown
</code></pre>

<p>The preferred format for blog posts is Markdown. However, if you have special
formatting needs, the post can be written in HTML directly.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a file in <code>web/_posts/</code> using the format
<code>YYYY-MM-DD-perma-link.markdown</code> for the file name.</li>
  <li>Write the post.</li>
  <li>In the <code>web/</code> directory, run <code>rbx -S jekyll</code>.</li>
  <li>Create a commit of all the changes in the <code>web/</code> directory.</li>
  <li>Submit a patch, or if you have commit rights, push the commit to master.</li>
  <li>Tell us that there is a new blog post. We may have some feedback for you
before publishing.</li>
</ol>
