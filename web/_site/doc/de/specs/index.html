<p>The Rubinius project generally uses TDD/BDD-style executable specifications to
drive development. The Rubinius &lsquo;spec&rsquo; directory is conceptually divided into
two parts:</p>

<ol>
  <li>All the files under &lsquo;./spec/ruby&rsquo; that describe the behavior of MatzRuby.</li>
  <li>And all the other files under the &lsquo;./spec&rsquo; directory that describe the
behavior of Rubinius.</li>
</ol>

<p>The specs at ./spec/ruby are a copy of RubySpec at a particular revision.
These are regularly imported from the RubySpec project and failing specs are
tagged so that the CI process always runs a known good set of specs. This
enables easily confirming that changes to Rubinius code do not cause
regressions.</p>

<p>Documentation about the organization of specs and guidelines for writing specs
can be found at the <a href="http://rubyspec.org/">RubySpec project</a>.</p>

<p>Use the following workflow when adding specs and code to Rubinius:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Write failing specs for some aspect of Ruby behavior. Commit the specs in
a separate commit to the appropriate files under ./spec/ruby.</li>
  <li>Add Rubinius code to make the specs pass. Again, commit these changes in
a separate commit from the spec changes.</li>
  <li>Run the <code>rake</code> command to ensure that all the CI specs pass.</li>
</ol>

<p>The changes to files in ./spec/ruby are regularly pushed to the RubySpec
project. Also, current changes to RubySpec from committers to other Ruby
implementations are regularly updated in the ./spec/ruby directories. When the
specs are updated from RubySpec, the CI tags are also updated.</p>
