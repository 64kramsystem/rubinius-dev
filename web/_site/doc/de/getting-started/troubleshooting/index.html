<p>The following are errors that you may encounter while building, installing, or
running Rubinius along with suggested solutions.</p>

<p>For any error, a first step is to ensure you have a current, clean checkout of
Rubinius. Before going further, consider running the following steps:</p>

<pre><code>$ git co master
$ git reset --hard
$ git pull
$ rake distclean
$ rake
</code></pre>

<p>Error:</p>

<pre><code>ERROR: unable to find runtime directory

Rubinius was configured to find the runtime directory at:

  /Users/brian/devel/rubinius/runtime

but that directory does not exist.

Set the environment variable RBX_RUNTIME to the location
of the directory with the compiled Rubinius kernel files.

You may have configured Rubinius for a different install
directory but you have not run 'rake install' yet.
</code></pre>

<p>Solution:</p>

<p>If you configured Rubinius with a <code>--prefix</code>, run rake install.</p>

<p>If you configured Rubinius with a <code>--prefix</code> and renamed the install
  directory after installing Rubinius, re-configure Rubinius and reinstall it.</p>

<p>If you renamed the source directory after building Rubinius, re-configure
  and rebuild it.</p>

<p>In general, do not rename the source or build directory after building
  Rubinius.</p>
