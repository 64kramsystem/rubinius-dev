      <p>The first ever <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23rbxday">#rbxday</a> is fast
approaching on Friday, August 5th. Depending on your time zone, that is either
tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. To help you get prepared, here are a few
updates.</p>

<p>Originally, the idea for <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23rbxday">#rbxday</a>
was a day that people all around the world could have fun experimenting with
Ruby and Rubinius. Try your application or pet Ruby project on Rubinius, or
pull out that idea you&rsquo;ve been wanting to explore, code it up, and run it on
Rubinius. We are not asking anyone to contribute to Rubinius, but we would be
most flattered if you wanted to dig into the Rubinius code to see what&rsquo;s going
on under the hood. To sum up, the motto of the day is &ldquo;Ruby, Rubinius, Fun Fun Fun Fun&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Of course, a great way to multiply fun is to share it with others. Several
people have taken the initiative of organizing meetups on
<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23rbxday">#rbxday</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Mountain View, CA</strong>: <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/bcurren">@bcurren</a> co-founder
of <a href="http://outright.com">Outright.com</a>, sign up at <a href="http://rbxday.eventbrite.com/">rbxday.eventbrite.com</a></li>
  <li><strong>Amsterdam</strong>: <a href="http://twitter.com/dbussink">@dbussink</a> long time
Rubinius contributor, event at <a href="http://80beans.com/en/blog/2011/07/29/rbxday-at-the-80beans-office">80beans</a></li>
  <li><strong>Portland, OR</strong>: <a href="http://twitter.com/kyledrake">@kyledrake</a> avid
Rubyist, event at <a href="http://piepdx.com">PIE</a>, see <a href="http://calagator.org/events/1250461183">Calagator.org</a> for details</li>
  <li><strong>Barcelona</strong>: <a href="http://twitter.com/txustice">@txustice</a> inventor of <a href="http://blog.txustice.me/2011/06/rexpl-interactive-bytecode-console-for-rubinius/">cool Rubinius technology</a>, event at <a href="http://blog.codegram.com/2011/8/celebrate-rbxday-with-us-at-codegram">Codegram</a></li>
</ul>

<p>A huge thanks to everyone who has organized one of these events. They did so
on their own initiative and show the true power of a community. If you&rsquo;re near
one of the events, please do attend. If not, <em>there&rsquo;s still time to organize
one near you.</em></p>

<p>If you are joining <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search/%23rbxday">#rbxday</a> from the
comfort of your own home, tweet about it, include pictures, and join us in
the #rubinius IRC channel on freenode.net. We would love to hear from you.</p>

<p>A final thought about all the ways you can help Rubinius. You don&rsquo;t have to
contribute code directly to help. Each of these activities is just as
valuable, and if you think of any I didn&rsquo;t include, please let me know:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Wearing your Rubinius shirt</li>
  <li>Talking to co-workers about Rubinius</li>
  <li>Asking your company to sponsor some of your time contributing to Rubinius</li>
  <li>Writing libraries in Ruby</li>
  <li>Writing blog posts or books about Ruby technology, like fully-concurrent
threads in JRuby and Rubinius 2.0</li>
  <li>Talking to people about what you find painful in Ruby and how we may be able
to improve those pain points</li>
</ul>

<p>Above all, please do have fun. That&rsquo;s no gimmick. The world needs more fun.</p>

<p>Put a tag on it <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search/%23rbxday">#rbxday</a>.</p>

      <p>Not only in the US is &#35;rbxday celebrated, but we have also something
in Amsterdam next Friday. It&rsquo;s really becoming the International Rubinius
Day that it was set out to be.</p>

<p>The guys are 80beans are sponsoring the event and have graciously offered
their office as the place to hang out and are providing refreshments. The
office is located on the Vijzelstraat 72 in Amsterdam and we&rsquo;re starting
at 3pm.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re living in the neighborhood, please come and join us. As long
term Rubinius contributor Dirkjan Bussink is coming over from the other side of
the country, so don&rsquo;t feel held back when you&rsquo;re not living in Amsterdam
itself.</p>

<p>So be prepared for an afternoon of very interesting hacking. We really want
to make it a fun afternoon of experimenting with Rubinius, so anything
goes! Please leave a message on the 80beans blog if you&rsquo;re planning to come over:</p>

      <p>Hey Ruby bytecode fans! The first ever <strong>International Rubinius Day</strong> is next
Friday, August 5th. Around the world people will be trying their code on
Rubinius and generally having a fun time. Follow the activities on Twitter
under the <em>#rbxday</em> tag and use that to let folks know what you&rsquo;re up to. Stay
tuned to the <a href="http://rbxday.rubini.us/">rbxday website</a> for details as the day
unfolds.</p>

<p>If you are located in, around, or within traveling distance of beautiful
Mountain View, CA, the terrific folks at <a href="http://outright.com">Outright.com</a>
are sponsoring a real live <em>#rbxday</em> event! Come hang out with a bunch of
hardcore Ruby nerds, including Brian Ford (that&rsquo;s me) from the Rubinius team.
Plan to be inspired by all the great stuff people are working on. There will
be mountains of top-shelf Rubinius schwag, as well as <em>free beer and pizza</em>.
(Just don&rsquo;t get too trashed as there will also be lightning talks and an IR
helicopter obstacle course.)</p>

<p>The <a href="http://rbxday.eventbrite.com/">party</a> will be from 1:00 pm to 8:00 pm on
Friday August 5th at Outright&rsquo;s offices in downtown Mountain View. (They have
an application that does some seriously awesome stuff with small business
accounting.) There are plenty of desks, monitors and whiteboards available, so
bring your laptop and be ready to jam.</p>

<p>Space is limited, and the coolest developers in the valley are already coming,
so if you know your stuff and want to have fun, <a href="http://rbxday.eventbrite.com/">rsvp
now</a>!</p>

<p>See you there!</p>

<p>The Rubinius 2.0 Preview Release is still cranking along. We&rsquo;re feeling good about how things are going. As always, thank you everyone for all of your contributions. The <a href="http://rubini.us/releases/1.2.4/#authors" title="Rubinius : Use Ruby&#8482;">list of authors on the 1.2.4 release</a> is just fantastic.</p>

<p>Moving forward to the 2.0 official release, we need more feedback from you about your code running on Rubinius. Not just what doesn&rsquo;t work and not just bugs (although both of those are important too), but how is your code performing, where are the bottlenecks, etc.</p>

<p>This is what we&rsquo;re going to do about that. Everyone&hellip; everyone all around the world that uses or cares about Rubinius and its progress, all of us on one day are going to run our code, collect performance data / bug reports and send them up to the Rubinius project.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23rbxday">#rbxday</a> is a party! Take pictures of you and your buddies on the day of. If you&rsquo;ve got a Rubinius t-shirt or sticker, get them in there. Tweet about it, now and on the day. Get excited. Tell your friends. Get them excited. Use the hashtag #rbxday in your tweets, blog posts and posts. We&rsquo;ll repost them all on the <a href="http://rbxday.rubini.us">#rbxday</a> site.</p>

<p>Make sure you&rsquo;re looking your best in your photos because we&rsquo;ll be picking a winner for our favorite <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search/%23rbxday" title="#rbxday search on Twitter">#rbxday</a> glamourshot.

      <p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure it started like this.</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>&ldquo;Grandma Betty!&rdquo; &mdash; <em>Evan</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>&ldquo;You know, I was thinking about your little Rubinius thingy while I was gardening today. How&rsquo;s it doing?&rdquo; &mdash; <em>Evan&rsquo;s Grandma Betty</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Grandma Betty, that&rsquo;s so sweet of you to think of me and it. It&rsquo;s coming along still, of course.&rdquo; &mdash; <em>Evan</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good to hear. I was specifically wondering how the 1.9 support is looking.&rdquo; &mdash; <em>Evan&rsquo;s Grandma Betty</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>&ldquo;Grandma Betty! You do always love the Latest and Greatest&trade;, don&rsquo;t you? Well, let&rsquo;s see. I&rsquo;d say that <em>1.9 support</em> comes down to 7 main areas: Encoding, String, Regex, Symbol, IO, Argument Processing, Windows Support. Each has varying degrees of progress.&rdquo; &mdash; <em>Evan</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>&ldquo;OK. I wish that there was some way for me to keep more up to date on these happenings without needing to calling you. When I call you, I want to hear about that wife and baby of yours.&rdquo; &mdash; <em>Evan&rsquo;s Grandma Betty</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>&ldquo;You got it, Grandma Betty. I&rsquo;ll get my Top Nerds&trade; on the case.&rdquo; &mdash; <em>Evan</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>[sometime later]</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>&ldquo;Alright, Grandma Betty. We made the Rubinius Status Board&trade; especially just for you. It&rsquo;s <a href="http://status.rubini.us">status.rubini.us</a>&rdquo; &mdash; <em>Evan</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>That conversation may or may not be <strong>completely fictionalized</strong>. There is one thing that is most emphatically true: Rubinius has a Status Board&trade; now. If you are ever curious how progress is going on things, go check out <a href="http://status.rubini.us">status.rubini.us</a>. Tell your friends.</p>

Keep spreading the good word to your friends and anyone who&rsquo;ll listen and care. And keep telling us how Rubinius is working for you. However good or bad, we want to know.</p>
