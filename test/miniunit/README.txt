miniunit by Ryan Davis
    http://rubyforge.org/projects/bfts

== DESCRIPTION:

miniunit is a completely minimial drop-in replacement for ruby's
test/unit. This is meant for language implementors to have a minimal
set of methods to bootstrap a working unit test suite.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Assertions are not yet complete, but enough for what we've ported
  from rubicon/rubytest.

== REQUIREMENTS:

+ Ruby 1.8, maybe even 1.6 or lower. No magic is involved.

== INSTALL:

+ sudo gem install miniunit or sudo rake install

== LICENSE:
