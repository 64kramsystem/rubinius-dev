1. What is Rubinius

Rubinius is an implementation of the Ruby programming language. Rubinius is
compatible with Ruby version 1.8.7.

Rubinius includes a Ruby parser, bytecode virtual machine, bytecode compiler,
generational garbage collector, and just-in-time (JIT) native machine code
compiler. Rubinius uses native OS threads with no global interpreter lock.
Rubinius also provides C-API compatibility for native C extensions.

The Ruby core library is written almost entirely in Ruby. Rubinius tools, such
as the bytecode compiler and debugger, are also written in Ruby.  Rubinius
provides the same standard libraries as Matz's Ruby implementation (MRI) with
the following exceptions:

* Continuation
* Ripper
* TracePoint
* Tracer

Rubinius runs on Mac OS X and many Unix/Linux operating systems.  Microsoft
Windows is not yet supported.

Most popular Ruby applications, like Rails, run on Rubinius.

Rubinius uses the BSD license. See LICENSE for details.


3. Installing Rubinius from Source

To install Rubinius, use the following steps:

  1. Ensure that MRI 1.8.7+, rubygems, rake, and git are installed
  2. git clone git://github.com/rubinius/rubinius.git -b 1.8.7
  3. cd rubinius
  4. bundle
  5. ./configure --prefix=/path/to/install/dir
  6. rake

When the install process finishes, follow the directions printed to the
terminal to add the Rubinius executable (bin) directory to your PATH.

If you are unable to build melbourne during the rake step you may be using an
incompatible version of bison. Rubinius 2.x/melbourne 2.x can be built with
bison 3.x but Rubinius 1.x/melbourne 1.x must be built with bison 2.x

On Debian and Ubuntu variants, a good way to have both versions installed is to
use update-alternatives. You can accomplish this by either installing bison
via apt-get and then moving files around, or installing both versions by source.

It's unknown at this time if moving the package manager-installed files will
break updates by the package manager in the future, so the steps below will
outline how to build via source.

1.  wget http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bison/bison-2.5.1.tar.gz
2.  wget http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bison/bison-3.0.2.tar.gz
3.  tar xzf bison-2.5.1.tar.gz
4.  tar xzf bison-3.0.2.tar.gz
5.  cd bison-2.5.1/
6.  ./configure --program-suffix="-2.5.1" --datarootdir=/usr/share/bison-2.5.1
7.  make && sudo make install
8.  cd ../bison-3.0.2/
9.  ./configure --program-suffix="-3.0.2" --datarootdir=/usr/share/bison-3.0.2
10. make && sudo make install
11. sudo update-alternatives \
      --install \
        /usr/local/bin/bison \
        bison \
        /usr/local/bin/bison-3.0.2 \
        150 \
      --slave \
        /usr/share/bison \
        bison-share-dir \
        /usr/share/bison-3.0.2/bison
12. sudo update-alternatives \
      --install \
        /usr/local/bin/bison \
        bison \
        /usr/local/bin/bison-2.5.1 \
        100 \
      --slave \
        /usr/share/bison \
        bison-share-dir \
        /usr/share/bison-2.5.1/bison
13. sudo update-alternatives --config bison

4. Using RubyGems

Rubinius comes with RubyGems built-in. To install a gem, run the following:

  rbx -S gem install <gem_name>


5. Documentation

After installing Rubinius, run 'rbx docs' to access the built-in documentation
at any time.
